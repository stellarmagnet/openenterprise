Software is the most modern technological tool that has features that makes operating society more efficient. Open Enterprise is an open source application suite that will have the features needed to organize communities or organizations of any size. It would be a platform with a unified user experience, and allow users to customize with plug & play components. It should eventually include the following features, accessible from a single location: 

* Social Networking
* Private Messages, Group Messages and Chat Rooms
* Task Management
* Project Management
  * Work breakdown structures, Gantt, Dependencies
* Crowdfunding, Cryptoequity
* Crowdsourcing, Skill Matching
* Learning, Knowledge Bases, Tutorials
* Event Organization
* Governance & Decision Making
* Document Collaboration
* File Sharing
* Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
* Resource Management & Pooling
* Finance & Collective Budgeting

... amongst many other planning/finance/collaboration features to maximize operational efficiency

The Open Enterprise app should allow for the logo, colors, fonts to be customized so each organization can feel like the platform is theirs.

# Next Steps

We should look at the previous research in features done by the [Collaborative Technology Alliance](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Collaborative_Technology_Alliance) and create an actionable and prioritized roadmap.

Choosing [aragonOS](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS) as the base layer for this application would be the best approach. With planned integrations such as [Giveth](https://giveth.io/) modules, the [Harbour](https://github.com/HarbourProject/protocol) voting app, the proposed [Aragon Planning app](https://github.com/aragon/nest/pull/24), a lot of needs will have already been met.

The social networking/forum design patterns developed by [Space Decentral](https://spacedecentral.net) can be enhanced and migrated toward this ecosystem and help "glue" together the apps.  

The next steps are to:
* come up with a unified design pattern
* prioritize features and ensure that the current development work proposed above is interoperable
* refactor code as needed and migrate to a unified codebase
