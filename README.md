Software is the most modern technological tool that has features that makes operating society more efficient. Open Enterprise is an open source application suite that will have the features needed to organize communities or organizations of any size. It would be a platform with a unified user experience, and allow users to customize with plug & play components. It should eventually include the following features, accessible from a single location: 

* Social Networking
* Private Messages, Group Messages and Chat Rooms
* Task Management
* Project Management
  * Work breakdown structures, Gantt, Dependencies
* Crowdfunding, Cryptoequity
* Crowdsourcing, Skill Matching
* Learning, Knowledge Bases, Tutorials
* Event Organization
* Governance & Decision Making
* Document Collaboration
* File Sharing
* Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
* Resource Management & Pooling
* Finance & Collective Budgeting

amongst many other planning/finance/collaboration features to maximize operational efficiency

# Next Steps
We should look at the previous research in features done by the [Collaborative Technology Alliance](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Collaborative_Technology_Alliance) and create an actionable and prioritized roadmap.

Choosing [aragonOS](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS) as the base layer for this system would probably be the best approach. With [Giveth ](https://giveth.io/) modules and the [Harbour](https://github.com/HarbourProject/protocol) voting protocol eventually being integrated into Aragon, in addition to the proposed [Aragon Planning app](https://github.com/aragon/nest/pull/24), and social networking/forum design patterns developed by [Space Decentral](https://spacedecentral.net), a lot of needs will have already been met.

What we need to do is come up with the a unified design pattern and begin to prioritize features and ensuring that the current development work proposed above is interoperable, and refactor code as needed and migrate to a unified codebase.

The Open Enterprise app should allow for the logo, colors, fonts to be customized so each organization can feel like the platform is theirs.
