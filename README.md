Software is the most modern technological tool that has features that makes operating society more efficient. Open Enterprise is an open source application suite that will have the features needed to organize communities or organizations of any size. It would be a platform with a unified user experience, and allow users to customize with plug & play components. It should eventually include the following features, accessible from a single location: 

* social networking
* private messages and chat rooms
* complex project planning tools with work breakdown structures, gantt, dependencies
* crowdfunding/crowdsourcing
* skill matching
* learning/tutorials
* ability to organize meetings/events
* governance / collective decision making
* document collaboration
* data science tools
* resource management/pooling
* collective budgeting
* artificial intelligence
* amongst many other planning/finance/collaboration features to maximize operational efficiency

# Next Steps
We should look at the previous research in features done by the [Collaborative Technology Alliance](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Collaborative_Technology_Alliance) and create an actionable and prioritized roadmap.

Choosing aragonOS as the base layer for this system would probably be the best approach. With Giveth modules and the Harbour voting protocol added onto Aragon, in addition to the proposed Planning app, a lot of needs will have already been met.
