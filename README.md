Software is the most modern technological tool that has features that makes operating society more efficient. Open Enterprise is an initiative to create an open source application suite that will have the features needed to organize communities or organizations of any size. It would be a platform with a unified user experience, and allow users to customize with plug & play components. 

Choosing [aragonOS](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS) as the base layer for this application would be the logical approach, as there are planned integrations with [Giveth](https://giveth.io/), the [Harbour](https://github.com/HarbourProject/protocol) voting app, and the proposed [Aragon Planning app](https://github.com/aragon/nest/pull/24). Some of the forum, project and profile design patterns that are being prototyped by [Space Decentral](https://spacedecentral.net) will be enhanced and migrated to React and IPFS to be compatible with this decentralized ecosystem.

This ecosystem should eventually include the following features, accessible from a single location, with the ability for the organization to "plug & play" the features needed: 

* Social Networking
* Private Messages, Group Messages and Chat Rooms
* Task Management & Project Management
  * Work breakdown structures, Gantt, Dependencies
* Crowdfunding, Cryptoequity
* Crowdsourcing, Skill Matching
* Learning, Knowledge Bases, Tutorials
* Event Organization
* Governance & Decision Making
* Document Collaboration & File Sharing
* Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
* Resource Management & Pooling
* Finance & Collective Budgeting

Organizations should be able to customize the logo, colors and fonts so everyone can feel like the platform is theirs.


# Next Steps

We should look at the previous research in features done by the [Collaborative Technology Alliance](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Collaborative_Technology_Alliance) and create an actionable and prioritized roadmap.

The next steps are to:
* come up with a unified design pattern
* prioritize features and ensure that the current development work proposed above is interoperable
* refactor code as needed and create a unified codebase
